## Magic 8-Ball

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that can answer any "Yes" or "No" question with a different fortune each time it executes.

- `name` and `question` variables are hardcoded into the program.
- `random` module with `randint()` used to generate a random number within a specified range.
- `if`, `elif` and `else` used to select answers and `print()` out appropriate response.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Magic 8-Ball](./magic-8.py)
  - Have the user input their name and question.

## Sal's Shipping

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Salâ€™s Shippers.

- `weight` variable is hardcoded into the program.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Sal's Shipping](./shipping.py)
  - Have the user input the packages weight.
