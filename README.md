## Magic 8-Ball

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that can answer any "Yes" or "No" question with a different fortune each time it executes.

- `name` and `question` variables are hardcoded into the program.
- `random` module with `randint()` used to generate a random number within a specified range.
- `if`, `elif` and `else` used to select answers and `print()` out appropriate response.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Magic 8-Ball](./magic-8.py)
  - Have the user input their name and question.
