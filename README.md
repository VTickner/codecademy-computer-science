# Intro To Programming

## Carly's Clippers

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that calculates some metrics from lists of data.

- 2D lists of hairstyles, prices and last week's sales are hardcoded into the program.
- `for`, list comprehensions, `range()`, `len()` and `if` are used to calculate average prices, decreased prices, total revenue, average daily revenue and types of haircuts that cost less than £30.

## Len's Slice

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that takes pizzas and their prices using lists and alters the lists to organise the data.

- 2D lists of pizzas and prices are hardcoded into the program.
- `list.count(item)` used to count how many pizzas are $2.
- `len(list)` used to count the number of different kinds of pizzas.
- `list.sort()` to sort the list in ascending order of price.
- `list.pop()` to remove the most expensive pizza.
- `list.insert(index, item)` to add a new pizza in appropriate position to keep price sorted in list.
- `list[:3]` to find the cheapest three pizzas.

## Gradebook

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that takes student data and organizes subjects and grades using lists.

- 2D lists of subjects and grades are hardcoded into the program.
- `list.append(item)`, `list[index].remove(item)` are used to alter subjects and grades and `print()` out gradebook information to the user.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Gradebook](./intro_to_programming/gradebook.py)
  - Have the user input the initial subjects and grades.
  - Have the user be able to alter subjects and grades.

## Sal's Shipping

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.

- `weight` variable is hardcoded into the program.
- `if`, `elif` and `else` used to calculate cost shipping and `print()` out costs.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Sal's Shipping](./intro_to_programming/shipping.py)
  - Have the user input the packages weight.

## Magic 8-Ball

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that can answer any "Yes" or "No" question with a different fortune each time it executes.

- `name` and `question` variables are hardcoded into the program.
- `random` module with `randint()` used to generate a random number within a specified range.
- `if`, `elif` and `else` used to select answers and `print()` out appropriate response.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Magic 8-Ball](./intro_to_programming/magic-8.py)
  - Have the user input their name and question.
