# Intro To Programming

## Gradebook

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that takes student data and organizes subjects and grades using lists.

- 2D lists of subjects and grades are hardcoded into the program.
- `list.append(item)`, `list[index].remove(item)` are used to alter subjects and grades and `print()` out gradebook information to the user.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Gradebook](./gradebook.py)
  - Have the user input the initial subjects and grades.
  - Have the user be able to alter subjects and grades.

## Sal's Shipping

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Salâ€™s Shippers.

- `weight` variable is hardcoded into the program.
- `if`, `elif` and `else` used to calculate cost shipping and `print()` out costs.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Sal's Shipping](./shipping.py)
  - Have the user input the packages weight.

## Magic 8-Ball

The aim of this project was to create a Python program that can answer any "Yes" or "No" question with a different fortune each time it executes.

- `name` and `question` variables are hardcoded into the program.
- `random` module with `randint()` used to generate a random number within a specified range.
- `if`, `elif` and `else` used to select answers and `print()` out appropriate response.

### Code & Potential Improvements

- Solution URL: [Magic 8-Ball](./magic-8.py)
  - Have the user input their name and question.
